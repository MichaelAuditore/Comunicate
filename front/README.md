# Comunicate-Front-Production

### Welcome to Comunicate

A social media app to connect with others, it is a simple application to do some things like send requests and delete it, see latest messages, see friend requests, search people connected to the app.

### This is an application in building

There are some functions temporarily unable.
I began building client-side with ReactJS but it was occurs some problems with requests to API

### You can connect with AWS Cognito

When you register, you receive an special token to do transactions to API, API URL is http://node-env.eba-6csu6jky.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/

If you don't have a right token you cannot do requests to api
